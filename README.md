## Available Scripts



For project to work properly add the chrome extension :

## Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *

You need this extention because fetching the data isn't allowed without the correct permission and CORS

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Because of the permission allowed with the API you will need to clikc the next and prev button twice.
